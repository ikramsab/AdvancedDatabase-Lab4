# Lab: Java Database Connectivity (JDBC)

The goal of the lab is to write a utility class named DataAccess that enables an application to transparently access its data, using high-level Java methods. The DataAccess class is meant to hide from the application how its data is actually stored (here, in a relational database) as well as all the complex machinery required to access it (here, JDBC library and SQL statements).

## Getting Started

This is an example of how you may give instructions on setting up your project locally.
To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

### Prerequisites

For the purpose of this lab you will need 
* IDE such as Netbeans, IntellijCode or Visual Studio Code
In my case , i work on VS code
* You will need the Java Extension :[Extention pack for java](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vscjava.vscode-java-pack)



### Installation

1. Get a free API Key at [https://example.com](https://example.com)
2. Clone the repo
```sh
git clone https://github.com/your_username_/Project-Name.git
```
3. Install NPM packages
```sh
npm install
```
4. Enter your API in `config.js`
```JS
const API_KEY = 'ENTER YOUR API';
```


### Description

Despite the fact that you writing a technical document, it needs to be clear. Describing your project makes it easier for people to contribute to it and alos use it!

In this project you wil find the following readMes:

 - [Android Project ReadMe template](https://github.com/tamzi/ReadMe-MasterTemplates/tree/master/android)
 - [Web project template](https://github.com/tamzi/ReadMe-MasterTemplates/tree/master/website)
 - A General contibutions guide in each project

### Exercise 1
The needed arguments are :

* url link
* username
* passeword

To stock them in **String[] args** :

### Exercise 2

1. All the files are in markdown format. While it is good to learn markdown. It is always great to have the [Markdown CheatSheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) bookmarked somewhere in your browser.
If you can learn it, awesome! It will save you time...But it really is not important: **the more you use markdown, the better you get at it O.o**.

2. There are different Markdown templates for each type of project as below: 
    * [Android](https://github.com/tamzi/ReadMe-MasterTemplates/tree/master/android)- For android focused ReadMe
    * [Website](https://github.com/tamzi/ReadMe-MasterTemplates/tree/master/website)- For your HTML&CSS JS projects
    * [brief](https://github.com/tamzi/ReadMe-MasterTemplates/blob/master/brief/brief.md)  - minimal version
    * IOS ...coming soon - FOr IOS projects
    * Scripts ....coming soon - For Python, JS type projects


3. Copy the respective files depending on the type of project. Paste it and edit the file.

4. As a general rule, provide link to download the app if its published on the playstore /website if it is hosted at the description section above.See image below
